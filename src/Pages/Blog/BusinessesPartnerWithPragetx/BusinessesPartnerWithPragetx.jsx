                        <h3>What Does it Mean By Agile IT Collaboration?</h3>
                        <p>The IT industry has plenty of collaborations, including complete B2B partnerships, influential collaborations, project collaborations, team collaborations, strategic alliances, network collaborations, talent collaborations, etc. So you might be wondering what particular collaboration type I am talking about.</p>
                        <p>The agile IT collaboration stands for a combination of collaborations defined before, which ensures meeting the shared goals of collaborating parties. Here, for PragetX, agile IT collaboration could be project collaboration, strategic alliance, or talent collaboration - also known as staff augmentation.</p>

                        <p>On the other hand, agile IT collaboration could also be defined as providing services on-demand on a contract basis till the shared interests or goals are achieved. And the PragetX Technologies LLP works on the same collaboration. The team at PragetX strives to collaborate with other IT firms for multiple projects with alliances like talent exchange, project exchange, and strategic &amp; branding partnerships.</p>
