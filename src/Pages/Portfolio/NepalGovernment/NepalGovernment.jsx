                            <p>The Hanumannagar Municipal Corporation app was developed to ease the ease for local citizens to file reports for the problems they are facing due to insufficient work of the corporation. Using this application, citizens can find the contact information of the corporation officers, ward officers, etc. Citizens can register their profile in the application for corporation references. They can also fill out forms for their different problems and issues. In short, this application is an easy way to reach out to corporations to embrace citizenship awareness and empowerment for better city functioning.</p>

                            <p>We listened to all the requirements that the client conveyed to us. After a deep requirement analysis, we came up with a solution to develop the application in a Flutter tool using the DART programming language and a proven project delivery timeline. Once we received approval from the clientâ€™s end, we started to figure out the right profile to align for this development.</p>

                            <p>We already had approved the mobile app development approach from the client's end, but the only thing left was to align the right development team for the implementation as it was a huge and reputed project (Government & Public Sector). After countless resumes and in-house team analysis, we created a development team of 4 members for this project: one was the technical team leader with 10+ years of industry experience, and three flutter developers with 3-7 years of industry experience.</p>
                            <p>Each team member has great problem-solving skills, professionalism, and impressive communication skills with clients, which is our star company policy. As the flutter library codes and directories keep changing all the time, it was quite challenging for a team to maintain the application's working condition. They had to check the libraries each and every day.</p>
                            <p>Luckily, despite all hurdles, their positive working attitude and calm nature came as a great help and helped us deliver the project before the given deadline with perfection.</p>

                        <p>This mobile application is very important for all Nepal corporators' offices and citizens to ensure the better functionality of their government and public sector, which this application indeed provided to them. This application is not available on the play store or application store as they wanted to keep it limited to their region only. But soon, the Nepal government is planning to keep this mobile application on public platforms.</p>
