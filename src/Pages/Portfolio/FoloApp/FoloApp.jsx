                            <p>As we already knew that the client wanted us to build a cross-platform development, we connected our 3+ years of experience containing Flutter Developer with the client for him to understand the complete app development requirement. After getting on board for the project, the developer understood the requirement and analysed the Astroyogi and Astrotalk apps to understand their working.</p>
                            <p>He then developed the Folo App development roadmap and explained the whole development lifecycle to the client, which he really liked. With the affirmative sign from the client, our Flutter Developer started the implementation of the Folo App.</p>
                            <p>During the development of this app, the developer faced many difficulties in implementing the auto call hang up function after the customerâ€™s wallet get exhausted. But with a positive approach to problem-solving and learning, he finally succeeded to implement that function and delivered the app to the client with QA and security testing.</p>
